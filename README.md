# YOLOV3-Obj_detect_colab
This project demonstrates the implementation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) for small object detection. YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection system known for its speed and accuracy. This project focuses on detecting small objects in images or videos, which is often challenging for traditional detection models.
